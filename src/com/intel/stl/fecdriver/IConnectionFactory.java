 *  Archive Log:    PR 128897 - STLAdapter worker thread is in a continuous loop, even when there are no requests to service. A new FEAdapter is being added to handle requests through SubnetRequestDispatchers, which manage state for each connection to a subnet.

 *  Archive Log:    STLConnection lifecycle support. STLConnections can now be reused and temporary connections are not cached and their socket is closed after they are logically closed. Changed SubnetDescription in support of failover to have a list of HostInfo objects instead of just info for one host.

 *  Archive Log:    SubnetContext are now created after a successful connection is made to the Fabric Executive, otherwise a SubnetConnectionException is triggered. Also, waitForConnect has been postponed until the UI invokes SubnetContext.initialize (thru Context.initialize). This way the UI shows up faster and the UI progress bar reflects more closely the process.
